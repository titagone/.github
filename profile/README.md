[Titagone](https://titagone.com) is a French Software company, with a
strong expertise in programming languages & formal methods, and 10+
years' experience in state-of-the-art developments. Open-source is
part of our DNA!


We have developed an expertise in several programming languages, and
of course, we are always happy to learn new ones or even create them!

Here is a list of languages that we have used or developed tooling
for:

* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org): we use OCaml a lot for language tooling, and participate in the development of an optimizing compiler
  for [Jane Street Ltd](https://janestreet.com)

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr): we use Rust for most of our performance critical code, we are also giving
  extensive (training courses on Rust)[https://training.ocamlpro.com]

* [COBOL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol): as part of our [SuperBOL project](https://get-superbol.com), we modernize tooling for
 COBOL power users, and participate in the maintainance of [GnuCOBOL](https://github.com/OCamlPro/gnucobol)

* [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/): we work on tooling
  to target Wasm from other languages and to perform bug finding on them
  by performing various Wasm static analysis such as symbolic execution, in particular the [Owi toolbox](https://github.com/ocamlpro/owi)

* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/): we have been quite involved in blockchain development in the past (we developed the
  prototype of the (Tezos blockchain)[https://tezos.com] from 2014 to 2018), and developed tooling for
  several smart contract programming languages, among which Solidity, Liquidity, Michelson.
